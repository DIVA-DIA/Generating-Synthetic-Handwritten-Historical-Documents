# CycleGANRD

Base of CycleGan is from https://github.com/aitorzip/PyTorch-CycleGAN with small changes.

Base of the reading discriminator is from https://github.com/georgeretsi/HTR-ctc and heavily changed. It was primarly used for the data loader and to have a functioning base to build on top of that. The model CRNN is adopted without changes from https://github.com/olivernina/nephi

All code additions and changes were done by me as part of my master thesis and the following publication. If there are any questions about the code I'm always happy to answer them at manuel.drazyk@unifr.ch .
